# Prediction-Of-Heart-Disease-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project various machine learning algorithms are used for prediction of presence or absence of heart disease. Algorithms are applied on the data set taken from the UCI repository.
## The Aim is:
Analyzing the various machine learning algorithms and finding the best to predict the presence or absence of heart disease. The target that will be explored is binary classification which is 0 to show the absence of heart disease and 1 to show the presence of heart disease.
## Overview of the steps involved:
I will be using a number of different features about a person to predict whether they have heart disease or not. The independent variables are a patients different medical attributes and the dependent variable is whether or not they have heart disease. The various machine learning algorithms used for this model will be Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. The scores of all these models will be compared by splitting the data into training and testing in an approximate 80:20 ratio. We will also tune the hyper parameters for all these models to yield the best results. After finding the best algorithm, various metrics will be explored to assure the accuracy of the algorithm. And finally conclude the best prediction model for our heart disease dataset.
